## Question 1 - Multiclass SVM

Implement and compare multiclass methods, focusing on One vs One. Complete a custom OvO classifier for SVM.

## Question 2 - Linear Regression

Predict abalone age from physical measurements using linear regression. Implement closed-form and gradient descent solutions.

## Question 3 - Decision Tree
