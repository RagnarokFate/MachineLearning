## Submission Date: 18/06/2024, 23:59

### Topics Covered:
- Perceptron
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Kernels

## Background:
This assignment will provide hands-on experience with fundamental machine learning algorithms and techniques, including perceptrons, logistic regression, gradient descent, and SVMs. You'll apply these methods to various classification problems.

### Requirements:
- Submissions must be done in pairs.
- Ensure code is clean, concise, and well-commented.
- Submit only the notebook (`.ipynb`) format.
- Answer questions in red within the notebook.
- Include all plots, results, and outputs.
- Original work only; plagiarism will result in a grade of 0 and disciplinary action.

## Steps for Use:
1. **Clone the Repository:** Download the assignment notebook and associated data files.
2. **Set Up Environment:** Install necessary libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `gensim`) using `pip install`.
3. **Load Data:** Follow instructions for loading and preprocessing the data for each question.
4. **Implement Algorithms:** Write required functions and classes as outlined.
5. **Run and Test:** Execute code cells to train and evaluate models, testing on both training and testing datasets.
6. **Document Results:** Answer questions and document findings in the notebook.
